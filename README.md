# Mission-to-Mars

# Purpose
  The purpose of this assignment was to build a web based app that will allow the user to scrape multiple websites in order to retrieve up to date information
  about the planet Mars. The data that was extracted was stored in a NoSQL data base and an HTML page was created in order to show the results.
